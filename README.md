# Sign-Language-Recognition
App to recognize and display the meaning of signs. The jester dataset was used for training which contains image sequences for different kinds of gestures. I used 5 gestures from the dataset. I tried different methods like writing my own CNN, retraining Inception and VGG. Passing the encoded data to a custom RNN to recognize image sequences. The file live.py contains the code to test the app.
